                  <li>We chose to do this because many topics from the career are kind of difficult to fully understand without any type of web page like Stack Overflow where
                      you can discuss the topic or a specific problem, and Stack Overflow most of the times gives a more generalized answer and not what you are actually
                      looking for, so this will help students get helpful and more focused information.</li>

            weaknesses, what learning experiences or learning disabilities have been documented in the area, which groups of people relate these experiences. This report must
            have at least six bibliographic references, which could be from books or digital source, document both the situation in the private sector and academic research.</i></h6>

              <li><b>StackOverFlow:</b> In a general way regarding solutions to problems with coding, StackOverFlow is a web page which works as a discussion board. Here, users
                  ask questions about specific issues in their own codes. A disadvantage with this webpage is that the answers won’t help with more general doubts or theoretical ones,
                  but more regarding logical errors inside an specific problem. Also the answers might not be completely reliable since anyone can give their own opinion and most of
                  them will give the solution instead of a clear explanation.<br>Go to the references </li>
              <li><b>Plan de Estudios de Profesional:</b>This is the official webpage created by the Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey(ITESM). The page
                  provides information regarding the courses seen in the career of ISC. The courses can be organised by category or period(semester). When clicking the course key,
                  specific information such as credits, equivalences and suggested bibliography are displayed.<br>Go to the references </li>
              <li><b>Plan de Estudio ISC2011:</b>Created by students of ISC from the campus, it displays what the Plan de Estudios Profesional does but in an easier and more interactive
                  presentation. It lacks some important information such as suggested bibliography and its main focus is to help the users to decide the order for taking the courses, more than
                  the content of the courses themselves.<br>Go to the references</li>
              <li><b>Khan Academy:</b> This webpage has more specific information about many different topics and is divided by subjects. One of the things that makes it stand out is the use
                  of videos with examples for explanations and also its simplicity and self-paced style. What we are trying to pursue is also this kind of auto learning but including the categories
                  divided by specific needs of our users.<br>Go to the references </li>

Alternatively, could be presented the evidence that there is no solution as you intend to propose or making evident in what ways your proposal makes the difference on existing solutions.</i></h6>
          <p class="card-text">You should be an enrolled student at Tec de Monterrey to have access to the content of the courses that are given in the campus, and we haven’t come across any page that does anything similar.
            <br><br>
            If we got official support from the teachers we could make this a hub for students to get legitimate and reliable information. One of the things we’ve heard teachers complain about is that when students try to search for information themselves they often find things that either aren’t accurate or they get confused because the teacher explained it differently, with this web page we could help mitigate those problems by giving them the information from a web site previously selected by the teacher.
            <br><br>
            Our web page could be a nice alternative to blackboard, or it could have some integration with it, maybe a link inside Blackboard that sends you to our page.
